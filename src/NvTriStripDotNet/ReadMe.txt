NOTE: THIS CODE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED YET.

This is a .NET port of NvTriStrip (http://www.nvidia.com/object/nvtristrip_library.html).

Credit goes to Curtis Beeson and Joe Demers for the basis for this stripifier and to Jason Regier and 
Jon Stone at Blizzard for providing a much cleaner version of CreateStrips().
