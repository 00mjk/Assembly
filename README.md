# Assembly #
## Third Generation Blam Engine Research Tool ##

__Assembly is currently in the ALPHA stage. Some features may not work correctly. However, you are encouraged to submit bug reports through our issue tracker: [https://github.com/Xerax/Assembly/issues/new](https://github.com/Xerax/Assembly/issues/new "Assembly Issue Tracker").__

__Also, an Xbox 360 capable of running unsigned code is required in order to use modifications created with Assembly. Flashed disc drives will not work.__


Assembly is a free, open-source Halo cache file (.map) editor that was built from the ground up. It allows users to create and distribute creative patches for game content.

Assembly was designed with three goals in mind: 

* __Flexibility__ - Assembly is capable of opening files targeted for Halo 3, Halo: Reach, and Halo 4, and includes a system which allows users to add in support for other formats with ease.
* __Speed__ - Spend more time researching and less time waiting for trivial tasks to complete. Even the largest tags load extremely quickly with invisible fields enabled, and the meta editor's search feature allows users to find values with ease.
* __Usability__ - Built using Windows Presentation Foundation and utilizing modern UI design concepts, Assembly is both easy to use and easy to look at.
